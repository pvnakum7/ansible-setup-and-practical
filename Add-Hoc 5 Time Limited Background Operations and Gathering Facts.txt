Add-Hoc 5 Time Limited Background Operations and Gathering Facts
 

--->Long running operations can be run in the background, and it is possible to check their status later. 

For example, to execute long_running_operation asynchronously in the background, with a timeout of 3600 seconds (-B), and without polling (-P):


Commnad: 
ansible appserver -B 3600 -P 0 -a "/usr/bin/long_running_operation --do-stuff"




---->Polling is built-in and looks like this:

ansible all -B 1800 -P 60 -a "/usr/bin/long_running_operation --do-stuff"


----->Use for only<------ 
Typically youâ€™ll only be backgrounding long-running shell commands or software upgrades. 

------>Not use for Copy module<------
---->Backgrounding the copy module does not do a background file transfer.<----

---->Playbooks also support polling, and have a simplified syntax for this.





------>ansible all -m setup<-------
Facts are described in the playbooks section and represent discovered variables about a system.

These can be used to implement conditional execution of tasks but also just to get ad-hoc information about your system.

--->Command
 ansible appserver -m setup
