Deploying From Source Control and manage services


---->Deploy your webapp straight from git: <------


ansible devserver -m git -a "repo=https://github.com/pvnakum7/calculator.nodejs.git dest=/srv/calculator version=HEAD"


Since Ansible modules can notify change handlers it is possible to tell Ansible to run specific tasks when the code is updated, 

such as deploying Perl/Python/PHP/Ruby directly from git and then restarting apache.





-----> Managing Services<------
--->Ensure a service like htppd is started on all webservers:

 ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"


--->Alternatively, restart a service on all webservers:

ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=restarted"


--->Ensure a service is stopped:

ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=stopped"
