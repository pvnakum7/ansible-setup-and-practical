Playbooks-3 Tasks list


Here is what a basic task looks like. As with most modules, the service module takes key=value arguments:


tasks:
  - name: make sure apache is running
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started


---->The command and shell modules are the only modules that just take a list of arguments and donâ€™t use the key=value form. This makes them work as simply as you would expect:

tasks:
  - name: enable selinux
    command: /sbin/setenforce 1


----->not zero
The command and shell module care about return codes, so if you have a command whose successful exit code is not zero, you may wish to do this:    

tasks:
  - name: run this command and ignore the result
    shell: /usr/bin/somecommand || /bin/true

Or this:

tasks:
  - name: run this command and ignore the result
    shell: /usr/bin/somecommand
    ignore_errors: True




---->If the action line is getting too long for comfort you can break it on a space and indent any continuation lines:

tasks:
  - name: Copy ansible inventory file to client
    copy: src=/etc/ansible/hosts dest=/etc/ansible/hosts
            owner=root group=root mode=0644
