Playbooks-2  Hosts and Users


The hosts line is a list of one or more groups or host patterns, 
separated by colons 

--->remote_user

---
- hosts: webservers
  remote_user: root


 ----->
 Remote users can also be defined per task:

 ---
- hosts: webservers
  remote_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: test connection
      ping:
      remote_user: yourname 


 -----> Support for running things as another user is also available     
 ---
- hosts: webservers
  remote_user: yourname
  become: yes



----->You can also use keyword become on a particular task instead of the whole play:

---
- hosts: webservers
  remote_user: yourname
  tasks:
    - service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
      become: yes
      become_method: sudo



----->You can also login as you, and then become a user different than root:

---
- hosts: webservers
  remote_user: yourname
  become: yes
  become_user: postgres



----->You can also use other privilege escalation methods, like su:

---
- hosts: webservers
  remote_user: yourname
  become: yes
  become_method: su



----->You can also control the order in which hosts are run. 
The default is to follow the order supplied by the inventory:

- hosts: all
  order: sorted
  gather_facts: False
  tasks:
    - debug:
        var: inventory_hostname


Possible values for order are:

inventory:
    The default. The order is ‘as provided’ by the inventory
reverse_inventory:
    As the name implies, this reverses the order ‘as provided’ by the inventory
sorted:
    Hosts are alphabetically sorted by name
reverse_sorted:
    Hosts are sorted by name in reverse alphabetical order
shuffle:
    Hosts are randomly ordered each run
